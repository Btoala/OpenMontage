"""Session-wide test safety net.

**No test may open a network connection.** Provider tools bill per call, so a
test that reaches a real endpoint costs the developer money — silently, and
every time CI runs. This blocks outbound sockets for the whole test session.

The guard is at the socket layer on purpose. Patching `requests` only covers
tools that use `requests`; the fleet also talks to vendor SDKs (google-cloud,
openai, boto3), `httpx`, and raw `urllib`. Everything bottoms out in
`socket.connect`, so that is where the wall goes.

Loopback is still allowed — local servers, ffmpeg RPC, and Backlot fixtures need it.

To write a test that genuinely hits a live API:

    @pytest.mark.live_api
    def test_real_call():
        ...

Marked tests are **skipped by default** and only run with the env flag set:

    OPENMONTAGE_ALLOW_NETWORK=1 pytest -m live_api

Limitation: this guards the pytest process. A test that shells out to a
subprocess (node, ffmpeg, npx) is outside its reach — don't call paid APIs
from a subprocess in tests.
